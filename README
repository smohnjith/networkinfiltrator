Will only compile on Linux/Unix systems (tested on Mac OS X, Debian & Ubuntu)

1. Download the .zip of the source, or clone using git.

2. Open up a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the source, e.g.

	cd /home/<username>/Downloads/network-infiltrator

3. build the project by typing:

	make

4. The output will be an executable called 'ninf' in the same
   directory. Execute it like this:

	./ninf


note: you must have Make and GCC installed. If the above fails then try
installing Make and GCC like this:

----------------Linux/Unix----------------

Open up a terminal.

On Debian or Ubuntu, type:

	sudo apt-get install gcc make binutils libc-dev

	
On Fedora or Red Hat, type:

	sudo yum install gcc make binutils glibc-devel

----------------Mac OSX----------------

Download Xcode, which will install all the tools you need
to compile C programs using the Terminal app.

Xcode is FREE to download.
