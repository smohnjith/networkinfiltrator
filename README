Will only compile on Linux/Unix systems (tested on Mac OS X, Debian & Ubuntu)

1. Download the .zip of the source, or clone using git.

2. Open up a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the source, e.g.

	cd /home/<username>/Downloads/network-infiltrator

3. build the project by typing:

	make

4. The output will be an executable called 'ninf' in the same
   directory. Execute it like this:

	./ninf


note: you must have Make and GCC installed. If the above fails then try
installing Make and GCC like this:

----------------Linux/Unix----------------

In a terminal, type the following commands:

	sudo apt-get install make
	sudo apt-get install gcc


----------------Mac OSX----------------

	download MacPorts: http://www.macports.org

In a terminal, type the following commands:

	sudo port install make
	sudo port install gcc	



After downloading Make and GCC, try steps 3 and 4 again.
